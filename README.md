# Common Module Hooks for Beaver Builder Modules - Proposal [Draft]

This is a working draft proposal for a set of common module hooks for Beaver Builder module development. These hooks are designed to lessen the need to override built-in modules or create very similar custom modules.

## Hook Opportunities
* Module Class Names
* Module wrapper attributes
* Before module output
* After module output
* Additional filter: register_module forms
